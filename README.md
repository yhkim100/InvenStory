Project Description:
This application is designed to allow a user to build a database inventory of products.  Other
information such as quantity, cost, and a thumbnail image are provided as supplementary data.

Minimium SDK Version: 21
Target SDK Version: 23




Completed Tasks:

Completed Task 1: Initiate Application
Once the application starts, a welcome screen initiates. A login screen will pop-up if the user is
not already authenticated with the application.

Completed Task 2: Register User
If the user is not already authenticated, they will be prompted to register or log in.

Completed Task 3: Take a picture
The user has the option to take a picture, the app connects to the device's camera and  allows the
user to take a picture. Once a picture is taken, it is stored as a full image on the device.

Completed Task 3: Create a New Element
Create a new item in the application that has multiple fields for title, author, quantity, and
price. The application checks to see if this item already exists and gives option to update
quantity.

Completed Task 4: Receive and Store User Input Data
Create text fields in a list view for each field for item. The user is responsible for entering this
data.

Completed Task 5: Add to list
The application stores each item in a list. It is ready to add another item. There is an option to
update the database and go back to the homescreen.



Changes from Initial Sprint:
+ Login Feature for Unique User
+ Register User into database
+ Splash Screen on Startup

- Thumbnail picture not saved to new elements.
- Does not check for duplicate items already in database.
